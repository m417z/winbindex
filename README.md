# Winbindex

An index of Windows binaries, including download links for executables such as exe, dll and sys files.

All linked binary files are hosted on the Microsoft public symbol server (msdl.microsoft.com), Winbindex merely indexes metadata that enables to generate those links.

The website, along with the whole database, is hosted on GitHub in this repository, and is served with GitHub Pages. The database is updated on a regular basis by Python scripts that are also located in this repository. The scripts and the database reside in the [data](https://github.com/m417z/winbindex/tree/gh-pages/data) folder.
